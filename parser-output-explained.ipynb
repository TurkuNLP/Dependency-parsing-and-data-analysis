    "\n",
    "**Universal Dependencies (UD)**\n",
    "  * Open community effort to create cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages\n",
    "  * Main effort in dependency-based syntax annotation\n",
    "  * Guidelines for:\n",
    "    * Segmentation\n",
    "    * Morphology\n",
    "    * Lemmatization\n",
    "    * Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation of UD**\n",
    "  * Increasing interest in multilingual NLP\n",
    "    * Studies involving several languages\n",
    "    * Multilingual evaluation\n",
    "    * Cross-lingual learning - learn from English data, adapt the knowledge for Finnish data\n",
    "  * All these studies rely on annotated data\n",
    "    * Annotation schemes differ between corpora annotated for the same task\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design principles of UD\n",
    "  * UD needs to be satisfactory on linguistic analysis grounds for individual languages.\n",
    "  * UD needs to be good for linguistic typology, i.e., providing a suitable basis for bringing out cross-linguistic parallelism across languages and language families.\n",
    "  * UD must be suitable for rapid, consistent annotation by a human annotator.\n",
    "  * **UD must be easily comprehended and used by a non-linguist, whether a language learner or an engineer with prosaic needs for language processing. We refer to this as seeking a habitable design, and it leads us to favor traditional grammar notions and terminology.**\n",
    "  * UD must be suitable for computer parsing with high accuracy.\n",
    "  * UD must support well downstream language understanding tasks (relation extraction, reading comprehension, machine translation, …).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Disclamer**\n",
    "  * Despite of the common guidelines, adaptation can vary between different treebanks\n",
    "    * Language-specific additions\n",
    "    * Language-specific omissions\n",
    "    * Treebank level annotation practices\n",
